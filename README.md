All results from this open-source code or our [demo website](https://bhaasha.iiit.ac.in/lipsync) should only be used for research/academic/personal purposes only. As the models are trained on the <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/lip_reading/lrs2.html">LRS2 dataset</a>, any form of commercial use is strictly prohibited.

Prerequisites
-------------
- `Python 3.6` 
- ffmpeg: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`
- Install necessary packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Alternatively, instructions for using a docker image is provided [here](https://gist.github.com/xenogenesi/e62d3d13dadbc164124c830e9c453668). Have a look at [this comment](https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip/issues/131#issuecomment-725478562) and comment on [the gist](https://gist.github.com/xenogenesi/e62d3d13dadbc164124c830e9c453668) if you encounter any issues. 
    - Besides, there is also a updated dockerfile for RTX3090 GPU, see [dockerfile](./dockerfile).
- Face detection [pre-trained model](https://www.adrianbulat.com/downloads/python-fan/s3fd-619a316812.pth) should be downloaded to `face_detection/detection/sfd/s3fd.pth`. Alternative [link](https://iiitaphyd-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/prajwal_k_research_iiit_ac_in/EZsy6qWuivtDnANIG73iHjIBjMSoojcIV0NULXV-yiuiIg?e=qTasa8) if the above does not work.
Getting the weights
----------
| Model  | Description |  Link to the model | 
| :-------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: |
| Wav2Lip  | Highly accurate lip-sync | [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/153HLrqlBNxzZcHi17PEvP09kkAfzRshM?usp=share_link)  |
| Wav2Lip + GAN  | Slightly inferior lip-sync, but better visual quality | [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15G3U08c8xsCkOqQxE38Z2XXDnPcOptNk/view?usp=share_link) |


Lip-syncing videos using the pre-trained models (Inference)
-------
You can lip-sync any video to any audio:
```bash
python inference.py --checkpoint_path <ckpt> --face <video.mp4> --audio <an-audio-source> 
```
The result is saved (by default) in `results/result_voice.mp4`. You can specify it as an argument,  similar to several other available options. The audio source can be any file supported by `FFMPEG` containing audio data: `*.wav`, `*.mp3` or even a video file, from which the code will automatically extract the audio.
##### Tips for better results:
- Experiment with the `--pads` argument to adjust the detected face bounding box. Often leads to improved results. You might need to increase the bottom padding to include the chin region. E.g. `--pads 0 20 0 0`.
- If you see the mouth position dislocated or some weird artifacts such as two mouths, then it can be because of over-smoothing the face detections. Use the `--nosmooth` argument and give it another try. 
- Experiment with the `--resize_factor` argument, to get a lower-resolution video. Why? The models are trained on faces that were at a lower resolution. You might get better, visually pleasing results for 720p videos than for 1080p videos (in many cases, the latter works well too). 
- The Wav2Lip model without GAN usually needs more experimenting with the above two to get the most ideal results, and sometimes, can give you a better result as well.
Preparing LRS2 for training
----------
Our models are trained on LRS2. See [here](#training-on-datasets-other-than-lrs2) for a few suggestions regarding training on other datasets.
##### LRS2 dataset folder structure
```
data_root (mvlrs_v1)
â”œâ”€â”€ main, pretrain (we use only main folder in this work)
|	â”œâ”€â”€ list of folders
|	â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ five-digit numbered video IDs ending with (.mp4)
```
Place the LRS2 filelists (train, val, test) `.txt` files in the `filelists/` folder.
##### Preprocess the dataset for fast training
```bash
python preprocess.py --data_root data_root/main --preprocessed_root lrs2_preprocessed/
```
Additional options like `batch_size` and the number of GPUs to use in parallel to use can also be set.
##### Preprocessed LRS2 folder structure
```
preprocessed_root (lrs2_preprocessed)
â”œâ”€â”€ list of folders
|	â”œâ”€â”€ Folders with five-digit numbered video IDs
|	â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ *.jpg
|	â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ audio.wav
```
Train!
----------
There are two major steps: (i) Train the expert lip-sync discriminator, (ii) Train the Wav2Lip model(s).
##### Training the expert discriminator
You can download [the pre-trained weights](#getting-the-weights) if you want to skip this step. To train it:
```bash
python color_syncnet_train.py --data_root lrs2_preprocessed/ --checkpoint_dir <folder_to_save_checkpoints>
```
##### Training the Wav2Lip models
You can either train the model without the additional visual quality discriminator (< 1 day of training) or use the discriminator (~2 days). For the former, run: 
```bash
python wav2lip_train.py --data_root lrs2_preprocessed/ --checkpoint_dir <folder_to_save_checkpoints> --syncnet_checkpoint_path <path_to_expert_disc_checkpoint>
```
To train with the visual quality discriminator, you should run `hq_wav2lip_train.py` instead. The arguments for both files are similar. In both cases, you can resume training as well. Look at `python wav2lip_train.py --help` for more details. You can also set additional less commonly-used hyper-parameters at the bottom of the `hparams.py` file.
Training on datasets other than LRS2
------------------------------------
Training on other datasets might require modifications to the code. Please read the following before you raise an issue:
- You might not get good results by training/fine-tuning on a few minutes of a single speaker. This is a separate research problem, to which we do not have a solution yet. Thus, we would most likely not be able to resolve your issue. 
- You must train the expert discriminator for your own dataset before training Wav2Lip.
- If it is your own dataset downloaded from the web, in most cases, needs to be sync-corrected.
- Be mindful of the FPS of the videos of your dataset. Changes to FPS would need significant code changes. 
- The expert discriminator's eval loss should go down to ~0.25 and the Wav2Lip eval sync loss should go down to ~0.2 to get good results. 
When raising an issue on this topic, please let us know that you are aware of all these points.
We have an HD model trained on a dataset allowing commercial usage. The size of the generated face will be 192 x 288 in our new model.
